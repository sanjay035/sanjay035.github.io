## About me
---
• I'm an individual learning, working on some problems with interest in data science, machine learning for the past 8+ months that gave me a good amount of mathematical intuition for most of the related concepts & applying the same that I've learnt.

• Currently working on deep learning stuff popular these days related to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and getting hands dirty & wet with it to gain intuition behind the deep generative models.

• Contributor for Analytics Vidhya (Medium).
