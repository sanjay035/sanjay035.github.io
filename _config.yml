  Have been learning, working on some problems with personal interest in Data Science, Machine Learning for last 8 months that gave me a good amount of mathematical intuition for most of the related concepts, applying the same that I've learnt.

  Currently working on some deep learning related stuff popular these days on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and getting hands dirty with it for gaining intuition behind the Generative models.
